These HTML snippets are then injected into the HTML pages, creating a set of full HTML pages without the maintenance nightmare of normal HTML apps.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n- Bash\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n\r\nTo install download the [latest version](https://github.com/TheConnMan/Resolver/archive/master.zip) and extract `resolver` into a permanant location. You can also move `resolver` to a location in your path for convenience.\r\n\r\n## Use\r\n\r\n### HTML Resolution\r\n\r\n**Resolver** uses a conventional tag to denote injected files shown below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<% resolver src=\"relative/path/to/my/file.html\" %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese file locations are all relative to the **root** (see options below) of the app, so even if a file references another file within its same subfolder the relative path will still include the subfolder of both files. An example of this can be found in the [example menu layout](https://github.com/TheConnMan/Resolver/blob/master/example/layouts/menu.html) which includes the [example submenu layout](https://github.com/TheConnMan/Resolver/blob/master/example/layouts/submenu.html) which is in the same folder.\r\n\r\nFiles are recursively resolved, so if an injected file also contains dependencies they will be resolved before injection.\r\n\r\nThere is a set of example pages under the **example** folder to help with the HTML syntax. It can also be used to try out **Resolver** before full use.\r\n\r\n## Dependency Resolution\r\n\r\nTo compile the finished HTML run the `resolver` command. Below is a list of the command options.\r\n\r\nUsage: `resolver [-r root] [-d dist] [-kwv]`\r\n- -r: root HTML directory to be crawled recursively\r\n- -d: distribution directory\r\n- -k: keep injected files\r\n- -w: watch root directory for changes\r\n- -v: verbose\r\n- -h: help\r\n\r\n## Support\r\n\r\nPlease use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/TheConnMan/Resolver/issues) to recommend additions or report bugs.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMIT","google":"UA-48858955-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
